- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?

I made 2 classes for this assignment. Player represents the character controlled by the user. When a player is created, it calls my other class, Blob, which represents the virtual blob that the player takes care of. The blob starts with some initial stats which are then affected by the methods called by the Player. For example, if the Player uses the item "food" the blob's energy will increase but fun will decrease. The player's goal is to take care of the blob by making sure blob's fun and energy never reach zero. 

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?

I did not add any additional methods in Player, but in Blob I added a toString method and an isAlive method to check if blob's energy and fun are above zero. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

The biggest challenge I encountered in this assignment was just coming up with a creative way to implement the methods. Once I had my idea, implementing the methods went pretty smoothly. One thing that really helped me remember how to make a constructor and implement certain methods was to look back at previous assignments. So I would advise someone taking this course to consult previous assignments, especially A6 and A7 in order to get a refresher on how to do everything.
